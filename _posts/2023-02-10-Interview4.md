Story Interview :

I've been playing Genshin Impact for 3 months now and recently started using the official
interactive map.

About pins:

It's awesome that I can log in with my Genshin account and sync my pins, but I'm still
figuring out how to make the most of it and be more efficient.
Right now, I only use it to mark the oculuses I've found and locate certain materials.
And, for some reason, when I try to view farming routes, it only shows the same 3-4 routes
repeatedly: Crystal ore, lamp grass, something else.
I also think there should be more different types of pins to mark other things.


About maps:

Some other things about the interactive maps. The official map crashes all the time when my
phone screen turns off, which is super annoying.
So, I did some research and asked some fellow players about unofficial maps they
recommend.
The unofficial one has a bigger comment section, with more images and many many times I
got useful tips there for stuff that was nearby or I would have missed if nobody pointed it out.
I play with the map open. Either I mark as I find stuff while exploring, or I pick a section of the
map and hunt everything there.
